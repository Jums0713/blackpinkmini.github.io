            Roseanne Chae-young Park (born February 11, 1997 in Auckland, New Zealand) better known as Rosé,

            When she found out that YG Entertainment were holding their auditions in Sydney, Australia back in
            2012, she quickly went there coming all the way from Melbourne to audition. Rose ranked first in
            the auditions, and she became a part of YG Entertainment on the same day. After training for four
            years, YG finally put her as the main vocalist and lead dancer of Blackpink. She was the last member
            to be revealed in the band. She attended Canterbury Girls' Secondary College in Melbourne, Australia.
